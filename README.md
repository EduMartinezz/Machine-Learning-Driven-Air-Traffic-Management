# Introduction
Air traffic management (ATM) plays a crucial role in ensuring safe and efficient air travel. This project leverages machine learning to optimize flight trajectories, predict air traffic patterns, and enhance sector capacity planning. Key challenges such as airspace congestion, trajectory anomalies, and efficient route allocation are addressed through data-driven methodologies.

# Project Objectives
The primary goals of this project include:
**Clustering Flight Trajectories:** Grouping flights with similar patterns to optimize air traffic flow.
**Predicting Trajectory Metrics:** Using Random Forest and LSTM models to forecast altitude, fuel consumption, and route charges.
**Congestion Management:** Identifying high-traffic zones and developing strategies for capacity optimization.
**Sector Analysis:** Evaluating sector-level air traffic and its impact on operational efficiency.
**Anomaly Detection:** Identifying deviations in flight trajectories for improved safety.

## Research Methodology
# The project follows a structured workflow:
__Data Collection:__ Extracted flight operation data from Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) and ALL_FT+ files.
__Data Preprocessing:__ Cleaning and structuring data, handling missing values, and transforming coordinates into geospatial formats.
__Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):__ Visualizing flight patterns, congestion hotspots, and operational metrics.
__Dimensionality Reduction:__ Utilizing PCA for simplifying trajectory data while retaining key variance.
__Clustering:__ Implementing hierarchical clustering and anomaly detection with Isolation Forest.
